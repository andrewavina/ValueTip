## Approach
- Started with wireframing and ERB modeling first. 
- Mapped out how the app should function based off of user stories before starting to code.   
- The user stories to begin with were:
    * As a user, I want to be able to have my own dashboard to have 1 central place to see latest info on my interests
	* As a user, I want to be able to see who my favorite NFL team is playing this week so I can plan to watch it.
    * As a user, I want to be able to listen to music from my favorite artist while on the same page as looking up my favorite NFL team and actor news.
    * As a user, I want to be able to see info on my favorite actors to stay up to date on their latest news.
