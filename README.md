# **ValueTip**

## ValueTip is for value investors who want to save time and effort searching for potential target stocks to invest in. The end goal of ValueTip will be to automate that search by leveraging web scraping and 3rd party API usage (e.g. Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, etc.). Technology used: React, Node.js, JavaScript, Express.js, JWT for authentication/authorization, MongoDB, axios, Heroku, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS

##Development version updates (for tracking before merging into master branch):
- made company name, stock ticker/symbol, and price required to enter on backend>models>stocks. no edits made to front end. stocks missing those fields should not appear on my report page after hitting save.
- added "Date of Price Point" to be able to start tracking when stock prices were what they were.
